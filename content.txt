ABOUT:

Our company was born from the idea of two Web Developers who decided to completely change their careeers
after realizing that, for them, the lunch break was more important than coding.
Born in Berlin way back in 1999, and located in the industrial district, Pixel Burger© remains one of the favorite destinations
for workers on the move who love to relax, satisfying their appetites with authenticity, style and excellent value for money.
